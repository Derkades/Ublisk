/**
 * <p>An <tt>OrderedHashMap</tt> is a <tt>java.util.HashMap</tt> with one
 * additional property: It maintains a list of the map's keys in the order
 * they were added to the map. This additional capability imposes a small
 * amount of extra overhead on insertion and a larger amount of overhead on
 * key removal, but absolutely no additional key lookup overhead. This
 * class is conceptually similar to (though less feature-rich than) the
 * <tt>java.util.LinkedHashMap</tt> class added in JDK 1.4.</p>
